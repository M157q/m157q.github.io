+ Manufacturer  
    + Hoozo in China  
    + Z100  
+ SImilar products sell for ~180 EUR to ~260 EUR  
+ Software from/modified by DPRK  
+ 南韓朋友幫忙拿到 Woolim 在北韓的廣告影片，現場播放。  
    + 背景音樂也太熱血 XDDD  
    + 廣告超級久啊，大概快五分鐘了吧。  
    + > Don't drive and watch TV (XDDD  
    + Free Warrantee service

##### Gaining Access  
  
+ They really lock the tablet excellently.  
+ The obvious things  
    + ADB enabled? => NO  
    + Can we enable it? => NO  
    + Developer options? => NO  
    + Can we install APKs? => NO  
    + Is there a recovery/reset mode? => NO

+ What to do next?  
    + Test Environment  
        + Cheap (about 30 bucks) A33 Tablet with similar functionality  
        + It worked and dumped out the storage layout.  
  
##### Distribution of Media files in DPRK: Achieving absolute control  
  
+ Multiple Ways of Tracing Media Distribution  
    + Watermarking introduced in Red Star OS  
        + Append simple watermarkds to media files  
    + Compatible code available on Woolim  
+ Red Star OS Watermarking Recap  
    + Plaintext: WMB48Z789B3AZ97  
    + `takeshixx/redstar-tools`  
+ Tracking the Distribution of Media Files  
    + Create social networks  
    + Construct connections between dissidents  
    + Track down sources  
    + Shutdown  
+ Woolim is More Restrictive than Red Star OS  
    + Introduces file signatures  
        + Using asymmetric cryptography [RSA]  
        + Goal: PREVENT the distribution of media files  
    + Government has full control over signatures  
        + Absolute control over media sources  
+ SIgnature Checking  
    + Java interface with native JNI library [gov.no.media.Sign]  
        + Called by apps e.g. during file opening/saving  
        + Sometimes concealed as "License checks"  
    + Multiple ways of signing  
        + NATSIGN  
        + SELFSIGN  
    + Files without proper signatures are forbidden.  
+ Java Native Interface Libraries  
    + Check if file has a proper signature  
    + Used by various applications, e.g.:  
        + FileBrowser.apk  
        + Gallery2.apk  
        + Music.apk  
        + ...  
+ NATSIGN  
    + Files that have been approved by the government  
        + Also referred to as "gov_sign"  
    + Files are signed with a 2048 bit RSA key  
+ SELFSIGN  
    + Combination of  
        + Symmetric encryption [Rijndael 256]  
        + Asymmetric signatures [RSA]  
        + Hashing [SHA224/SHA256]  
    + Device identity stored in `/data/local/tmp/legalref.dat`  
        + Comprised of IMEI and IMSI  
        + Each device's... legal reference  
    + Files created on the device itself can be opened  
        + Camera images, office documents, PDFs, etc.  
    + Signatures  
        + RSA signature of file hash  
        + Encrypted device identity  
            + Rijndael 256 (key and blocks)  
            + IMEI and IMSI  
        + Trailer  
            + Signature size  
            + ASCII suffix "SELFSIGN"  
        + FIxed size of 792 bytes  
+ File types affected by signing  
    + All kinds of media files  
    + Text and HTML files  
    + Even APKs...  
  
###### Absolute Control of Woolim's Media Sources  
  
+ NATSIGN  
    + Approved by the government  
+ SELFSIGN  
    + Created on the device itself  
+ Can not be shared to  
    + Other Woolim tablet PCs  
    + Other devices in DPRK  
    + Rest of World  
  
##### Supporters  
  
ISFINK  
  
##### Future Work  
  
+ Free some of the stuff from the tablet  
    + Dictionaries  
    + Books  
  
##### Q&A  
  
+ OS occupied about 1GB on Woolim  
+ Won't provice the dump of this device because it may put the owner of this device in danger.

## 33C3 Day 2 (2016.12.28 Wed)  
  
### How physicists analyze massive data: LHC + brain + ROOT = Higgs  
  
Axel Naumann, CERN - axel@cern.ch  
  
#### CERN  
  
+ European Organization for Nuclear Research, est. 1954, near Geneva  
+ What is mass? What's in the universe? Probing smallest scale particles: Higgs particle, super symmetry, ...  
+ Fact sheet  
    + 12,000 physicists  
    + from 120 nations  
    + CERN itself has about 2500 employees  
+ LHC (Large Hadron Collider)  
    + All build by physicists in CERN  
    + > You cannnot just by the gears on Amazon  
+ Life (Work) at CERN  
    + More laptops than people  
  
#### What we do in CERN  
  
+ Theory and Simulation  
    + Super super precise  
    + But LHC experiments also looking for unconfirmed / weird things  
+ Prediction versus Measurement  
    + When is a difference between "boring theory" and measurment.  
+ Weather vs Climate  
    + Measure temperatures  
    + Detect "abnormal" temperature variations  
+ Data and Uncertainties  
    + Our simulation has uncertainties from theory  
+ More Data Helps  
    + Correlating data helps  
    + Reduced measurement uncertainty helps  
    + more collisions = more data = higher changce to claim "we see something"  
  
#### Computers  
  
+ CPU Efficiency (CMS)  
    + Average 750%  
        + > 100% is for beginners  XD  
  
#### Measure effect of bugs  
+ Why not HDFS / HDF5 / Protobuf / ...  
+ Cling, C++ interpreter of CERN  
  
+ What we used in CERN  
    + Davix  
    + CernVM-FS  
    + ROOT  
  
#### Data analysis in CERN  
  
+ C++  
+ ROOT  
    + http://root.cern  
    + Serialization facilities  
    + Statistics tools  
  
這場的講者用掌聲的熱烈程度讓觀眾選擇要聽哪兩個部份，  
其實還挺誘答的，每次都是後者。  
總之就是在向大家介紹 CERN 在做什麼，然後找人進去做軟體。

T-shirts (20 EUR), Hoodie (35 EUR), Zipper (45 EUR) 大概下午一點多開賣，  
排隊的人超級多，果然世界各地的宅宅都會掉 Conference T-shirt 的坑。

### Gone in 60 milliseconds  
  
Richard Jones  
  
第一次看到英文的簡報用高橋流，搭配一些程式碼的截圖，感覺效果挺不錯的。  
詳細的講解怎麼攻擊 AWS Lambda 的思路，挺精彩的，但沒有現場 Live demo 就是。  
因為用高橋流講的很快，英打速度不夠快，加上我對 AWS 不夠熟，所以就不做筆記哩，看之後投影片會不會釋出吧。  
  
講者在演講後會釋出 AWS Infection Toolkit on GitHub (Miserlou/mackenzie)

### Recount 2016: An uninvited security audit of the U.S. presidential election  
  
J. Alex Halderman, Matthew Bernhard, University of Michigan  
  
+ 2 styles, 52 models of voting machines  
    + styles  
        + Optical Scan  
            + Computer counts paper balots as they're placed in ballot box  
        + DRE (Direct Recording Electronic)  
+ Long, Complicated Ballots  
+ Reverse engineering the voting machines  
    + Used movable memory card, could be installed malware on the machines  
+ Are U.S. Voting Machines Secure?  
    + Hart InterCivic eSlate, AVC Advantage, Sequoia AVC Edge, ... lots of card spread malwares  
    + Vulnerabilities for malware to stealing the vote result.  
+ Election Hacking  
    + Alter election-night results  
    + Denial of service  
    + Political interfeerence  
    + Challenges  
        + Need to swap <1% of votes in two states  
        + Machines aren't no connect with internet  
            + But use centralized election management computers  
            + Centralized election management computer programs ballots are dd into memory card before the election  
    + Hakcing a U.S. election machines is much more easier than you thought.  
    + Will we ever be able to confirm outcome was correct?  
    + Jill stein, 2016 Green Party U.S. presidential election candidates willing to help to demand a recount. (Any candidates can demand a recount if they pay the cost.)  
        + How to pay for the recount? => Crowd funding  
        + Where to recount? => Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania  
  
主要就是在講美國 2016 大選的問題，  
探討投票機是不是有可能被動手腳，  
以及講者參與要求重新計票的過程。

### The untold story of Edward Snowden's Escape from Hong Kong  
  
2013 年幫助史諾登逃出香港的人們  
（被稱為 Snowden's Guardians，大多數是難民，因為覺得史諾登的處境跟他們很像所以幫忙他），  
至今的處境仍然和三年前一樣悲慘，  
仍然居住在一樣狹小的空間，  
因為香港政府不讓難民在香港取得工作權，  
其子女在香港也拿不到國籍，  
成為 Stateless 的無國家遊民，  
所以希望可以透過群眾募資幫忙這些人，  
結果香港政府發現以後，  
把群眾募資的網站關閉，  
所以這場 talk 主要就是請大家把這兩個群眾募資的連結散佈出去，  
讓更多人可以幫助他們。  
  
https://www.gofundme.com/snowdenguardians  
https://fundrazr.com/snowdensguardians  
  
然後用 Skype 現場連線當初幫忙庇護 Snowden 的 Guardians 之一：菲律賓籍的 Vanessa，  
講述她遇到 Snowden 的過程，  
一個白人男子來敲她的門想尋求住處，  
但她的住處只有一張床，  
她把床讓給 Snowden 睡，  
自己則睡地板上。  
隔天早上，Snowden 請她幫忙買一份英文報紙，  
她才知道原來這個人是全球頭號通緝犯，  
但她仍然因為 Snowden 的危險處境而幫忙他，  
直到他逃離香港，期間還和家人一起慶祝 Snowden 30 歲生日，並一起吃生日蛋糕。  
  
現場有會眾問她「如果再讓妳選一次，妳會幫忙 Snowden 嗎？」  
她只簡短的回答一句「Yes。」
