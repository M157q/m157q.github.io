### cli  
  
+ [asciinema/asciinema: Terminal session recorder](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema)  
    + > Terminal session recorder and the best companion of asciinema.org.  asciinema is included in repositories of most popular package managers on Mac OS X, Linux and FreeBSD. Look for package named asciinema. See the list of available packages.  
    + 用來錄製 Terminal 的工具，可以錄一段 CLI 操作的影片在 Project 的 README 上做說明。  
  
  
### docker  
  
+ [Tips to Reduce Docker Image Sizes – Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/tips-to-reduce-docker-image-sizes-876095da3b34?gi=77e85c46cda2)  
  
  
### k8s  
  
+ [Daemon Sets | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/)  
    + > What is a DaemonSet? A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the pods it created.  
+ [kubernetes/helm: The Kubernetes Package Manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm)  
+ [GitHub - coreos/flannel: flannel is a network fabric for containers, designed for Kubernetes](https://github.com/coreos/flannel)  
    + > Platforms like Kubernetes assume that each container (pod) has a unique, routable IP inside the cluster. The advantage of this model is that it reduces the complexity of doing port mapping.  
  
  
### python  
  
+ 最近剛好遇到需要在 Flask 上使用 Celery 需求，於是參考了一下。  
    + [GitHub - miguelgrinberg/flask-celery-example: This repository contains the example code for my blog article Using Celery with Flask.](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-celery-example)  
        + > This repository contains the example code for my blog article Using Celery with Flask.  For details on how this all works, see my article Using Celery with Flask.  
    + [Using Celery With Flask - miguelgrinberg.com](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/using-celery-with-flask)  
        + > The topic of running background tasks is complex, and because of that there is a lot of confusion around it. I have tackled it in my Mega-Tutorial, later in my book, and then again in much more detail in my REST API training video.  
  
  
### scrum  
  
+ [Scrum Master – A Manager | Ullizee](https://guntherverheyen.com/2014/11/26/scrum-master-a-manager/)  
    + > Traditionally an individual is declared a ‘manager’ when having hierarchical control over other individuals. A traditional manager exerts power.  
    + 這篇介紹了 Scrum Master 是個怎樣的角色，基本上這個角色應該是沒有實權的。  
+ [Scrum 在亞洲行不通 | Thinking in Life](https://cyberrob.github.io/scrum/asia/taiwan/2017/07/01/scrum-in-asia-translated.html)  
    + 這篇文章非常詳細的說明了為什麼 Scrum 在亞洲不普遍而且無法普遍的原因，我覺得挺中肯的。
